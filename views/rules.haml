    %h1 Connect everything 2 - puzzle game
    %h3 Rules
    The <strong>rules</strong> of <em>connect everything</em> are simple: click on the pieces to rotate them in such a way that
    %ul
      %li
        every piece becomes <strong>connected</strong> to every other one, and
      %li
        there are no cables left unconnected (unconnected cables have white endpoints)
    The game is <strong>lost</strong> if you make a <strong>wrong move</strong> or you run out of time.

    To solve the game it might be useful to know that
    %ul
      %li there is only <strong>one</strong> correct solution to every game, and
      %li the solution has no cycles/loops
    Try to <strong>think logically</strong>! By logical reasoning it should be possible to find pieces that can only be oriented one way.
    
    %h3 Gameplay
    Use mouse <strong>clicks</strong> to rotate the pieces.

    %h4 Keyboard shortcuts
    %ul
      %li <strong>mark</strong>: The <strong>spacebar</strong> can be used to <strong>mark</strong> pieces as correct.
      %li <strong>move focus</strong>: Use either the <strong>arrow keys</strong> or <strong>wasd</strong> to move focus.
      %li <strong>rotate</strong>: Use <strong>j</strong> (counterclockwise) and <strong>k</strong> (clockwise) to rotate pieces.
      %li <strong>reset</strong>: If you started to turn a piece but decide that you aren't sure where the final placement should be, hit <strong>esc</strong> to reset it while it still has focus.  If you leave it in the wrong position without doing this, you'll lose!
