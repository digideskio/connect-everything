    %h2 Rules
    The <strong>rules</strong> of <em>connect everything</em> are simple: you need to rotate the pieces in such a way that
    %ul
      %li
        there are no endpoints left unconnected (they should not be white!), and
      %li
        every piece is connected to every other one
    To gain extra points try to solve the game using as few <strong>moves</strong> (mouse clicks) as possible and in as few time as possible.
    
    To solve the game it might be useful to know that
    %ul
      %li there is only <strong>one</strong> correct solution to every game, and
      %li there are no cycles
    
    %h2 Gameplay
    Use mouse <strong>clicks</strong> to rotate the pieces. The <strong>spacebar</strong> can be used to <strong>mark</strong> mark pieces: just hover the piece you want to mark with the mouse and then press the space key.
    It can for example be useful to mark pieces once you are sure of their orientation.
